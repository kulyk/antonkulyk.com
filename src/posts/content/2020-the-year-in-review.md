Oh damn. 2020 was a rough year for all of us. The pandemic and all of its consequences left a huge footprint on our lives.
I'm very sorry for people who have been harmed by everything that happened.

Anyway, it's still important to retrospect everything that happened.
Celebrate the good things and reflect on the bad ones. So the next time our planet makes a new turn around the Sun, we find ourselves a bit happier.

## The Beginning

The year started pretty usually. Funny thing, 2019-2020 was actually the first time I planned what I wanted to do and achieve within a year.
You know, we printed one of these year planners from the Internet and filled them together with my friends.
I still don't want to read it again, not to remind myself about everything that went wrong üòÇ

Expectations were high. I and my girlfriend had a trip to Paris booked, I dreamed about visiting Burning Man, I had tickets to concerts purchased, and many more. Still, I managed to attend [The Comet is Coming's](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Z5FMozvx15nUSUA6a9kkU) concert in January. It's a British contemporary jazz & electronics band with a truly unique sound.

## Right Before the Lock-down

I was lucky to have my last trip abroad right before the global lock-down at the beginning of March.
I visited my friend in Amsterdam (what a great place!) for a few days.

Then I took a train to Cologne, Germany. In Cologne, I've attended Morrissey's concert.
Despite the fact he's an asshole nowadays, it was still a dream for me to hear that music live. I've been listenings to The Smiths a lot when I was a teenager.

## COVID-19

I returned back home, and on the next day, the whole world started the lock-down.
Fortunately, no symptoms of COVID-19 appear in the next two weeks.

### All Remote

I've been working remotely for almost two years before Pix, so it was not that hard for me to switch.

Still, you often feel the need for something only when it's taken away from you. So staying home all the time became challenging.
Remote work before the pandemic was cool because you had no limits about the workplace. I've worked from other countries while traveling, from coffee shops and coworking spaces. But now we were stuck at home.

I found myself working much more hours a week than I did at the office. The line separating work from the rest of the world disappeared.

## Fresh Start

In September I realized I need to change something to escape that day-to-day boredom.
I've had a few sessions with a therapist. It helped me to find out the reasons I dive into work.

After some time, I finally found some energy and:

- started writing and sharing online (huge thanks for reading that, that's super important to me ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- started a [podcast](https://anchor.fm/nunormalno) with my best friend
- ich begann Deutsch lernen üá©üá™
- started visiting a gym
- read a lot and appeared in [Pocket's](https://getpocket.com) world top 5% readers (meh, been in top 1% last year)

### Music

I'm learning to sing for a couple of years already. This year I've recorded a song at the actual studio! It was a lot of fun.

For now, it's just a cover of Chris Isaac's ‚Äî Wicked Game, but I hope at some point I gonna try writing and playing my own stuff.
Anyways, for now, you can listen to me [here](/2020-review/wicked-game.mp3) if you're interested.

Signing gave me a clear picture of how skills are being developed. For almost two years I didn't like the way I sound and the progress I had felt not impressive.
But in a few days after the recording, I felt a huge step in my singing quality. After two years of practice, for the first time, I actually enjoyed the result.

There are still a lot of things I need to improve.
But it was a good reminder you have to be really interested in something, so you can work on that for a pretty long time until you become good at that.

## Conclusion and Plans for 2021

A lot of terrible things happened in 2020, but I'd like to be optimistic about 2021.
COVID is still there (and we need to wear masks!) and it will take some time until we can get back to the familiar lifestyle.

My top priorities in 2021 are being more present at the moment, spending time on new things & side-projects, and sharing more.

Hope our 2021 will be the best year we can imagine, take care!
