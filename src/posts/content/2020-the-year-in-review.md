Oh damn. 2020 was a rough year for all of us. The pandemic and all of it's consequences left a huge footprint of our lives.
I'm very sorry for people who have been harmed by everything happened.

Anyway, it's still extremely important to retrospect everything that happened.
Celebrate the good things and reflect on the bad ones, so the next time our planet makes a new turn around the Sun, we find ourselves a bit more happy.

## The Beginning

The year started pretty usually. Funny thing, 2019-2020 was actually the first time I planned what I wanted to do and achieve within a year.
You know, we printed one of these year planners from the Internet and filled them together with my friends.
I still don't want to read it again, just not to remind myself about everything that went wrong üòÇ

Expectations were high. Me and my girlfriend had a trip to Paris booked, I dreamed about visiting Burning Man, we had a lot of cool things planned at [Pix](https://pix.style), I had tickets to concerts purchased and many more. Still, I managed to attend [The Comet is Coming's](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0Z5FMozvx15nUSUA6a9kkU) concert in January. It's a british contemporary jazz & electronics band with a really unique sound.

## Right Before the Lock-down

I was lucky to have my last trip abroad right before the global lock-down in the beginning of March.
I visited my friend in Amsterdam (what a great place!) for a few days.

Then I took a train to Cologne, Germany. In Cologne I've attended Morrissey's concert, the ex front-man of my favorite teenager-times band The Smiths.
Despite the fact Morrissey nowadays is kind of an asshole, it was still a dream for me to hear that music live. Fortunately done!

## COVID-19

I returned back home, and on the next day the whole world started the lock-down.
Fortunately, no symptoms of COVID-19 appear in the next two weeks.

### All Remote

I've been working remotely for almost two years before Pix, so it was not that hard for me to switch.

Still, you often feel the need for something only when it's taken away from you, so staying home all the time became really challenging.
Remote work before the pandemic was cool, because you had no limits about the workplace. I've worked from another countries while traveling, at home, at coffee shops and coworking spaces.
Now all of us were stuck at home.

I found myself working much more hours a week than I did at the office because of the absent border between the work and the rest of the world.
Earlier, I could separate these easier because I could switch places and environments around me, but doing that at home was really difficult.

## Fresh Start

In September I just realized I need to change something to escape that day-to-day boredom.
I've had a few sessions with a therapist, and it helped me to clarify and accept how important it is to find time for things outside of work (sounds obvious, but for me it actually required effort)

I finally found energy and:

- started writing and sharing online (huge thanks for reading that, that's super important to me ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- started a [podcast](https://anchor.fm/nunormalno) with my best friend
- ich begann Deutsch lernen üá©üá™
- started visiting gym
- read a lot and appeared in [Pocket's](https://getpocket.com) world top 5% readers (meh, been in top 1% last year)

### Music

I'm learning to sing for a couple of years already. This year I've recorded a song at the actual studio! It was a lot of fun.

For now it's just a cover of Chris Isaac's ‚Äî Wicked Game, but I hope at some point I gonna try writing and playing my own stuff.
Anyways, for now you can listen me [here](/2020-review/wicked-game.mp3) if you're interested.

Signing gave me a clear picture of how skills are being developed. For almost two years I really didn't like the way I sound and the progress I had felt not really impressing.
But in a few days after the recording I felt a huge step in my singing quality. Two years of practice before first times I actually enjoy the result.

There are still a lot of things I need to improve, but it was a good reminder you have to be really interested about something, so you can wait for a pretty long time be become better in that.

## Conclusion and Plans for 2021

A lot of terrible things happened in 2020, but I'd like to be optimistic about the 2021.
COVID is still there (and we need to wear masks!) and it will take some time until we can get back to the familiar lifestyle.

My top priorities in 2021 are being more present at the moment, spending time on new things & side-projects, and sharing more.

Hope our 2021 will be the best year we can image, take care!
